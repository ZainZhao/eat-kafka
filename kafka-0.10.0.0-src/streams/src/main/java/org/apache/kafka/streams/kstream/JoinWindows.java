/**
 * The window specifications used for joins.
 * <p>
 * A {@link JoinWindows} instance defines a join over two stream on the same key and a maximum time difference.
 * In SQL-style you would express this join as
 * <pre>
 *     SELECT * FROM stream1, stream2
 *     WHERE
 *       stream1.key = stream2.key
 *       AND
 *       stream2.ts - before <= stream1.ts <= stream2.ts + after
 * </pre>
 * There are three different window configuration supported:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>before = after = time-difference</li>
 *     <li>before = 0 and after = time-difference</li>
 *     <li>before = time-difference and after = 0</li>
 * </ul>
 * A join is symmetric in the sense, that a join specification on the first stream returns the same result record as
 * a join specification on the second stream with flipped before and after values.
